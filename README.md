# Expansional Retrofitting for Word Vector Enrichment
Anonymous code repository for the paper submitted in EMNLP 2020.

## Main Codes are based on JupyterNotebook
Note that these main codes are uploaded before the deadline :)
1) RelatedWordExtractor.ipynb : Semantically related words extractor for Self-Extrofitting
2) ExtroScriptNotebook.ipynb : Script-like codes for Deep-Extrofitting
3) TextClassification.ipynb : Codes for downstream tasks.

Happily Enjoy running them!

## Other data resources
We are delayed for finding external storage to upload such large datasets (e.g., Word Embeddings).
They will be linked very soon!
